# WorkerTesting App

This repository provides a small web application to analyze some capabilities of web worker.

One part is dealing with the instantiation time of a web worker. The other part is testing data transfer time to send data to a worker in order to compare the techniques **Transferable Objects** versus **Structured Clones**.

Parts of the tests to analyze the data transfer time is originally written by [Eric Bidelmann](https://github.com/ebidel) for Google. It is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
